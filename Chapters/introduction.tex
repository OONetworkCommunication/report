The fruitshop is a webshop which consists of 3 different Spring boot services.\\ 


\textbf{Homepage service}\\
The Homepage service is the simplest service but could have big load of requests to it. Everyone entering the website needs to be navigated through Homepage service. 
The Homepage service only consists of a search bar and links to all of the other services within the fruitshop domain.\\ 

\textbf{Basket service }\\
The basket service is used to place and delete order. The basket gives an overview of the products chosen to be brought. The user can press the pay button to pay for the chosen products and thereby dismiss the transaction.\\ 

\textbf{Search service }\\
The search service gives the user opportunity of searching the entire available products within the scope of FruitShop. The end result of search service is a picture of product which was searched through search service.\\   

\textbf{Contact service}\\
The contact service gives user opportunity of contacting the FruitShop via e-mail. The service is there to help user if anything went wrong.\\


This project has main focus area is to understand, design&implement the following:  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Spring boot service
	\item Docker container
	\item Kubernetes
\end{enumerate}

The fruitshop has spring boot services which are packed using Docker containers to make make sure that the environment service is running inside, stays static and it isn't dependant of underlying system and libraries. 

Furthermore the Kubernetes is used to make the webshop more reliable and fault tolerant. The Kubernetes creates pods which contain replica of a services on different nodes within the cluster. The Kubernetes keeps track of the pods, if a pod dies then it creates a new pod on one of the nodes.
