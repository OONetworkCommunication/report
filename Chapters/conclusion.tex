The implementation of cloud using microservices along with Docker and Kubernetes made sense to use instead of using monolithic service. The purpose of this project was to get a taste of how the Microservices work within the domain of Cloud Computing. 

In this project the implementation of Config Server for the spring services made the overall services dynamics better and made it easier to modify the services. 

Docker was there to pack the services by all its dependencies and thereby achieving a static environment. 

Last but not least by using Kubernetes as cluster management the deployment of images on cluster became a easy task. Kubernetes also made it easier to manage the resources and automatically control the load on individual nodes. 

Overall we can conclude that these three technologies together makes the Cloud Computing maintainable, reliable and applicable.

%By using these 3 technologies the Cloud Computing system could contain thousands of services. The big challenge is to managing the requests between the services. When there are so many services, the services needs to communicate with each other and they do that by having REST API and there are dozens thousands of requests sent easy single time there is some computation. 

%There is utilized more bandwidth when using Microservices then Monolithic services. If the bandwidth is small then there can occur the phonomina of latency which can destroy overall performance of the system.
