\chapter*{Docker}

Docker containers allows packaging of software application with all its dependencies and libraries. It makes it easier to create, deploy and run the applications. The main purpose of Docker is to ship the whole application as a single package. 
By doing that the Docker ensures that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings the particular machine might have.
Docker has resemblance to virtual machines in a way, but Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that theyâ€™re running on. By using Docker one can bypass creating virtual machine for every application.
